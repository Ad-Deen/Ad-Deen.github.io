										<h3>Autonoumous swarm of drone (ongoing)</h3>
										<p>
											This is my 4th year semester project/thesis work with swarm robotic system using 
											multiple drones for surveillence, 3D mapping and coordinated navigation to ensure 
											autonomous flights and complete specific actions autonomously. We developed and 
											opensourced fully customizable quadcopter firmware on ESP32 platform as a part of the 
											thesis task. The Visual Inertial Odometry pipeline is now being built for a single drone.
											Once a single unit flight operation is stable enough we can shift to adding more units 
											in the system developing the swarm incrementally.

										<h3>Autonoumous Ground vehicle</h3>
										<p>
											I worked in the project as an undergraduate research assistant under the 
											supervision and funding of Dr. Shahidur Rahman. In the project I designed
											the vehicle steering system and feedback sensor frames, tested varios control 
											algorithms based on 3D perception feedback of our custom made stereo vision system. 
											Currently the autonomous navigation runs on local map based on segmentation model with 
											depth perception forming a BEV local map to costmap with potential feilds guiding the 
											trajectory . The main application target was to build an autonomous taxi system for students
											in the campus that has 24 hour service with automatic solar based charging station.

										<h3>Autonoumous Underwater Vehicle</h3>
										<p>
											I worked on the this project during our 3rd year as a research assistant under the 
											supervision and funding of Dr. Shahidur Rahman. I designed the hull carrier frame, 
											electronics assembly internal frame and internal system and installed proper 
											enclosure with running BLDC propellers. Finally I custom designed and built the 
											Bouyancy system for depth control of the bot. Our main application was under water 
											survey in the ocean and do sea bed mapping for oceanographic research. Also our 
											project qualified for SAUVC 2025 organized by IEEE Oceaninc Society in hosted by NUS 
											and NTU collaborations in Singapore

										Side by side with these big projects I also collaborated with like minded 
										people to apply robtics for human wellfare. Keeping that incentive in mind 
										I am presenting you my visionary projects for which I could not manage my 
										fund. But the least I could do is create a 3D demo of the systems of my visions
										I hope to implement someday.

											<h3 class="major">Autonoumous vertical farming</h3>
											<p>
												Due to climate change, food shortage is eminent. Keeping that in mind I 
												have visions of building concentrated agricultural zones to produce staple
												food fully autonomously on the sea like how oil riggs operate.

											<h3 class="major">Renewable energy from ocean wave</h3>
											<p>
												Besides solar cells, I wanted to harness the mechnical fluctuations of the ocean 
												wave due to ebb and flow in a massive scale. I can envision a sustainable electrical
												off grid system that can fuel a autonomous production system off shore. I couldn't 
												manage funds for the vision. But I have experience in creating PV based 200W off grid 
												systems during my research project in my 2nd year.

											<p>
												Worked on this project in my 2nd year undergraduate time. I believed we could 
												autonmously fight the pollution of our rivers by setting up this system and save 
												the aquatic lives of our rivers. Unfortunately this project was not endursed financially
												by Walton,a local electronics company in Bangladesh.

											<h3 class="major">free robotics tutorial for all</h3>
											<p>
												This was my personal effort to relay my gathered experience in robotics for 
												free for robotics comunity in my country. I also create youtube series on different 
												systems along with the tutorials of how we worked on the big projects, the challanges
												the skills required and how to learn them. I wanted a leave behind a basic tutorial on
												how the projects on UAV, AGv, AUV were done. So that the projects remain active for 
												my juniors in the campus.
